Algorithms-in-Java
==================
Implement common algorithms in Java

Graph
==================
```
org.java.algorithm.graph
  |
  --- org.java.algorithm.graph.basics
  |
  --- org.java.algorithm.graph.traverse
  |
  --- org.java.algorithm.graph.test
```


`org.java.algorithm.graph.basics` implementes the basic structure of graph including directed graph and undirected graph.

`org.java.algorithm.graph.traverse` implementes DFS and BFS. Both have two forms: static method and iterator.

`org.java.algorithm.graph.test` includes JUnit test cases.
  
  
Sorting
==================
```
org.java.algorithm.sorting
  |
  --- org.java.algorithm.sorting
  |
  --- org.java.algorithm.test
```

`org.java.algorithm.sorting` implementes merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, slow sort (selection sort and insertion sort).

`org.java.algorithm.test` includes JUnit test cases.
